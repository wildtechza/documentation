# Code Setup

## Choose a "dev" folder

Open WSL (open Terminal and run command `wsl`), you will get a prompt:
```
user@My-PC:/mnt/c/Users/usern_name$
```

Run the command `cd` to get to the Linux user home folder, prompt will look like:
```
user@My-PC:~$
```

Create a folder called dev here using
```
mkdir dev
```

Go into the dev folder with:
```
cd dev
```

Clone the "learning_dotnet_kubernetes" code base:
```
git clone git@github.com:wildtechza/learning_dotnet_kubernetes.git
```

Go into the cloned folder:
```
cd learning_dotnet_kubernetes
```

Open in Visual Studio Code:
```
code .
