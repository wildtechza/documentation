# Run Code

In the code base you will see the following:
```
ðŸ“¦learning_dotnet_kubernetes/
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚helm/
    â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“œhelmfile
    â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“œhelmfile.yaml
```

Go into the helm folder and run:
```
./helmfile apply
```

This should run all the code. If cannot run it or get and error you may need to give permissions and try again with:
```
chmod +x helmfile
```

When you have already applied the helmfile and want to sync any changes:
```
./helmfile sync
```
